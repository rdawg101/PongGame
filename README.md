# PongGame
Pong Game Project for CS 152 

Hello! This is a game I decided to design for a project for a programming paradigms class. My goal for this project is to create a functioning, simple, single-player pong game where the player plays against a bot, trying to score as much as they can before losing all 3 of their lives. The objective of this project is to have functioning game mechanics and logic (paddle, ball, score, and life properties and behaviors) while also having a game loop, high score display feature, sound design, and screen navigation. This project was made with Java Swing and is implemented using object-oriented programming, functional programming, and event-driven programming.
